## Contributing to Fly Examples
If you're reading this, thank you! That means you're interested in adding helpful tutorials and examples to our community-generated Fly Example guides. :) Below you will find detailed [steps](https://github.com/fly-examples/example-guide/new/patch-1#step-by-step-guide-to-creating-a-fly-example-guide) to contribute, [helpful links](https://github.com/fly-examples/example-guide/new/patch-1#helpful-links), and active [team members](https://github.com/fly-examples/example-guide/new/patch-1#helpful-links) you can reach out to throughout the process.

## Step By Step Guide to Creating A Fly Example Guide
- Submit a proposal in our Fly org issue tracker [here](https://github.com/superfly/fly/issues).
  - A good proposal answers what use case or developer need does this example address. 
  - It also gives a high level description of the technology being used and why it's useful.
  - Any open questions you may have for the team.
- Once the project has been approved by someone on the Fly team, you can get started. 
- Start with your own repository. When the time comes, we'll ask you to transfer it over to us.
  - The repository itself should carry all the example material. If you, for example, have multiple versions of the same file demonstrating different configurations, make sure those versions are available under a meaningful name.
  - READMEs in fly-examples should read like an informative article about the example. Why? Well, we use the Readme directly in our publishing system to ensure content is always up to date and avoid there being multiple steps in getting content updated. And because there's nowhere better to keep the content than with the example itself.
- If you have questions or need feedback while you're working through your example project, ping the team in the original proposal issue. We're always happy and available to help!
- Upon completion of your Example, approved by a Fly team member, we will ask you to transfer it over to us.
- That's it! When all else fails, open an [issue](https://github.com/superfly/fly/issues) or ping us on social. :)

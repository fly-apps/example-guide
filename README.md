# example-guide - A Guide for Examples

This is a guide to creating complete projects for fly-examples for all potential Fly Writers.

## What are Fly Examples?

A curated collection of example applications with detailed Readmes for Fly.io users to learn with and deploy, built by the community and the Fly team.

## Get Started

- Submit Example project proposal in our Writers' Room [here](https://community.fly.io/c/write/writers-room/8).
- Someone on the Fly team will provide feedback.
- Once we've approved your proposal, you're ready to create your repo.

## Your Repo

Start with your own repository. When the time comes, we'll ask you to transfer it over to us.

### The Readme

READMEs in fly-examples should read like an informative article about the example. Why? Well, we use the Readme directly in our publishing system to ensure content is always up to date and avoid there being multiple steps in getting content updated. And because there's nowhere better to keep the content than with the example itself.

### Files and Fly files

The repository itself should carry all the example material. If you, for example, have multiple versions of the same file demonstrating different configurations, make sure those versions are available under a meaningful name. 

## Where can I find my completed Example?
You can find your Example project in our [Guides](https://fly.io/docs/guides/) on our website along with a plethora of other contributions from our awesome community!
